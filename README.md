# paleographic-networks
Repository of code developed within the SNF SPARK project "Paleographic Networks" (https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/221210)
The repository contains the Python code of custom-made software, by Eythan Levy, for viewing a "paleographic network", i.e. 
a network consisting of paleographc features connected by their co-occurrence on the same inscription. The software works on
a database consisting of all the Iron Age provenanced Hebrew seals and seal impressions (see the HSS database at https://hebrewseals.com).
Tu run the software, execute file SPARK-main-script-with-GUI.py.
